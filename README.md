# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to the enclave of mini-projects and small games. I am brushing up on my Python skills and needed a place to put them. 

## Repository Contents

Here's a catalog of the curiosities:

  - Madlibs Generator: Fill in the blanks and generate stories that twist and turn with every word you choose.
  - Math Challenge: A fun math quiz game, ran out of the terminal, reminiscent of elementary school flashcards. Better hurry though, because it's timed! :D
